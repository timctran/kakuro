On 20190719, I finally set out to code a Kakuro solver.

By the next morning, I was thinking about the most efficient way to solve it! I was surprised how simple the puzzle was to solve compared to the variety of deduction I have to go through to solve it manually.

It's possible the solver doesn't solve every puzzle, and that'd be a feature I'd like to add down the road: taking a picture of a puzzle and parsing it into text.

As for now, I'd like to pivot the code I have and see if it is easily modded into a Sudoko solver.
